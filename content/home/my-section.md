This is a forum for early-career researchers across the globe to *exchange ideas* and *promote potential collaborations* in the fundamental study and propulsion-related applications of detonations. Due to the unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have lost the opportunities to meet each other in person at international conferences this year. We hope that this forum will be a platform for all of the young detonation researchers to keep in touch and make connections with their like-minded peers.

Next talk:
Hongxia Yang. Dynamic of cellular flame deformation and subsequent DDT mechanism after the head-on interactions with shock waves.

The problem of shock flame interactions from both burnt gas to unburnt gas and unburnt gas to burnt gas is studied in two Hele-Shaw type apparatus. Following the passage of a spherical shock from the burnt gas to the unburnt gas at ambient condition in a vertically oriented Hele-Shaw cell, the flame cusps go through a process of compression, elongation and reduction. Whereas subsequent to the interaction of weak shocks with the cellular flame from the unburnt gas to the burnt gas in the Hele-Shaw shock tube configuration, theflame cusps of the mixture of stoichiometric hydrogen-air with initial pressures below 0.2 atm are flattened and reversed backwards into the burnt gas with a modest flame area increase consistent with Richtmyer-Meshkov deformation of an inert interface. The reshock of the reversed flame, however, is able to rapidly form a detonation wave. The DDT mechanism, which turn out to be extremely efficient for a weak shock interacting with a finger flame in a narrow channel, relies primarily on the straining of the flame shape into an elongated alligator flame maintained by the anchoring mechanism in a bifurcated lambda shock due to boundary layers.
