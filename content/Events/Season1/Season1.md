Title:  Dynamics of Gaseous Detonations with Lateral Strain Rate
Speaker: Dr. Qiang Xiao, 
Position: Assistant Professor, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, China
Date: September 3, 2020

{{< youtube id="1zD0tVoUb10" title="S1E1: Dynamics of Gaseous Detonations with Lateral Strain Rate" >}}

Abstract:
The present talk examined the role of instability on the predictability of detonation dynamics by investigating detonations in mixtures with varying levels of cellular instability, from the less unstable hydrogen-oxygen-argon system to the highly unstable methane-oxygen. Steady detonation waves, propagated in channels with exponentially enlarging cross-sections, were obtained at the macro-scale. For all the mixtures tested, the characteristic D−K relationships, relating the detonation mean propagation speed with lateral flow divergence, were obtained directly from experiments and as well from the generalized ZND model with lateral strain rates using detailed chemical kinetics. The comparisons first demonstrated the excellent agreement between experiments and the ZND model predictions for the weakly unstable hydrogen-oxygen-argon detonations, while significant departures for the highly unstable hydrocarbon-oxygen detonations. The results further showed that the degree of departure between experiments and the theoretical predictions increases significantly with the detonation instability level. Such a strong link between the departure level and the detonation instability can be clarified by the role of significant unreacted gas pockets in the ignition and propagation mechanism of unstable detonations. Finally, a novel quasi-2D approach modelling the lateral boundary layer losses using Mirels’ theory was proposed for evaluating the effect of boundary layer losses on 2D detonation cellular structures.

Title: Performance of a Generic 4-Step Global Reaction Mechanism with Equilibrium Effects for DDT Investigations
Speaker: Mr. Mohnish Peswani
Position: Ph.D. candidate, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA

Abstract: 
A reduced 4-species, 4-step Global Reaction Mechanism(GRM), derived from detailed chemistry using a thermochemical approach, is investigated for four different reactive mixtures. The trade-off between preciseness of Elementary Reaction Mechanisms (ERMs), and
low computational overhead requirements of GRMs remains a dilemma in the application of chemical kinetic models to detonation problems. Reducing a reaction mechanism often compromises the chemical details, and reduces the scope of applicability of the derived model. This is largely due to the mixture chemistry having a vital influence on several key aspects of the detonation phenomenon like initiation, quenching, and the dynamics of the wave front and hydrodynamic structure during propagation. For detonation problems in particular, there has been an insufficient replication of the complex reality of the phenomenon through numerical simulations which has lead to a constant demand for more accurate and affordable models.
Four separate stoichiometric combustion mixtures are investigated, each involving acetylene, methane, propane, or ethylene mixed with oxygen. Each mixture exhibits very different global activation energies, heat release, and ignition characteristics.

Title: Does Cellular Structure of Detonation Determine its Propagation Limit?
Speaker: Dr. Xian Shi
Position: Postdoctoral Scholar, Stanford University, , Stanford, CA, USA 
Date: October 19, 2020

{{< youtube id="KnJodqO2F6E" title="S1E3: Does Cellular Structure of Detonation Determine its Propagation Limit?" >}}

Abstract:
The detonation limit behavior is studied with ozone sensitization in small, round tubes. Adding trace amount of ozone leads to size reduction of detonation cells and extends the occurrence of spinning detonations to lower initial pressures. In contrast, however, ozone addition produces a negligible effect on velocity deficit far from the detonation limit while providing a measurable extension of the limit. The change in velocity deficit caused by ozone does not correlate with the reduction in cell size, suggesting that the velocity deficit behavior is NOT solely a function of the detonation structure. By analyzing the velocity deficit data in the d/λ (the ratio of tube diameter to cell width) domain, two regimes of detonation limits are identified: a loss-governed regime where velocity deficiency results from various losses (mass, momentum, and heat) and is insensitive to cellular patterns and sizes, and a geometry-limited regime determined by the geometric accommodation of detonation structures. Ozone addition extends the detonation limit by moving the reactive mixtures away from its geometric detonation limit and promotes detonation propagation in miniaturized geometries.

Title: A Dynamical Systems Perspective on Rotating Detonation Waves
Speaker: Dr. James Koch
Position: Postdoctoral Researcher, the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, the University of Texas at Austin, USA 
Date: November 2, 2020

{{< youtube id="bb-6luwaMQw" title="S1E4: A Dynamical Systems Perspective on Rotating Detonation Waves" >}}

Abstract:
The formation of a number of co and counter rotating coherent combustion wave fronts is the hallmark feature of the Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE). The engineering implications of wave topology are not well understood nor quantified, especially with respect to parametric changes in combustor geometry, propellant chemistry, and injection and mixing schemes. In an attempt to shed light on the interplay of these physics, the RDE is examined through the lens of multi scale nonlinear dynamical systems. Specifically, we seek to leverage the applied mathematical field of nonlinear waves to investigate properties of these combustion fronts, comparing and contrasting their behavior to those admitted by canonical wave equations. These concepts are used to construct and analyze surrogate models of the RDE from both first principles (the forward modeling problem) and from data (the inverse problem).

Title: Hydrodynamics of planar detonations in non-homogeneous media
Speaker: Dr. César Huete
Position: Associate Professor, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain 
Date: November 20, 2020

{{< youtube id="lDSfXWCTNk8" title="S1E5: Hydrodynamics of planar detonations in non-homogeneous media" >}}

Abstract:
We present the asymptotic linear theory describing the propagation of a planar detonation front through a heterogeneous mixture of reactive gases consisting of random fluctuations in the fuel mass fraction. The study begins with the derivation of the transfer functions that are later used in a Fourier analysis of the detonation interaction with two- and three-dimensional isotropic heterogeneous fields to provide integral formulae for the turbulent kinetic energy, sonic energy and averaged vorticity and entropy production rates. Second-order corrections for the averaged Rankine-Hugoniot conditions are provided, along with analytical expressions for the deviation of the detonation propagation velocity with respect to that of the equivalent homogeneous mixture. Upstream inhomogeneities are found to speed up the detonation front, with a velocity amplification factor that depends on the properties of the fuel-air equivalence ratio, which translates into variations of the density and the heat release with the fuel mass fraction.

Title: Detonation propagation under the influence of spatially inhomogeneous energy release
Speaker: Dr. XiaoCheng Mi
Position: Post-doctoral researcher, McGill University, Canada 
Date: November 30, 2020

{{< youtube id="c0hYiEdRhWU" title="S1E6: Detonation propagation under the influence of spatially inhomogeneous energy release" >}}

Abstract:
The propagation of gaseous detonation waves in a medium with spatially inhomogeneous energy release are put to a rigorous examination via various systems of numerical simulations. The inhomogeneity is introduced via concentrating reactive material into regions which are separated by inert gaps while maintaining the same average energy density. With an adiabatic system, the averaged propagation speeds resulting from inhomogeneous media are compared to the ideal Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) speed for an equivalent amount of energy release. Velocities in excess of the CJ speed are found as the reactive regions are made increasingly discrete. These super-CJ waves can be understood as weak detonations due to the non-equilibrium state at the effective sonic surface. A detonation analogue model based on the Burgers’ equation, however, fails to capture this super-CJ propagation. A heuristic model is constructed using the Taylor-Sedov solution for point-source blast waves to qualitatively explain the wave propagation behavior in the limit of highly discretized sources. The influence of spatially discrete sources on the propagation limit of detonation waves confined by an inert, compressible layer of gas is also examined. The simulation results show that, for a sufficiently high activation energy, the spatial inhomogeneities assist a detonation wave to propagate beyond the limit that is encountered in a homogeneous medium. Implications of this enhancing effect will be discussed.

Title: Dynamics of cellular flame deformation and subsequent DDT mechanism after the head-on interactions with shocks
Speaker: Miss Hongxia Yang
Position: PhD candidate, Northeastern University, China
Date: December 14, 2020

{{< youtube id="3va1F28eRbk" title="S1E7: Dynamics of cellular flame deformation and subsequent DDT mechanism after the head-on" >}}

Abstract:
The problem of shock flame interactions from both burnt gas to unburnt gas and unburnt gas to burnt gas is studied in two Hele-Shaw type apparatus. We show experimentally, numerically and theoretically, following the passage of the incident shock, the compressed flame goes through four stages. At times significantly less than the characteristic flame burning time, the flame front deforms as an inert interface dictated by the non-linear Ricthmyer-Meshkov (R-M) instability or for a decaying cylindrical shock wave by the combined effect of the R-M instability and the stabilizing Rayleigh-Taylor instability. At times comparable to the laminar flame time, dilatation due to chemical energy release amplifies the growth rate of inter interface. The deformation of the flame due to one shock lasts approximately one flame time before abruptly terminated by the transverse burnout of the resulting flame funnels, followed by a longer front re-adjustment to a new cellular flame. A flame evolution model was proposed to provide the prediction of the evolution of the flame geometry and burning rate for arbitrary shock strength and flame properties in two-dimensions. The re-shock of an initial finger flame in the narrow channel, however, turn out to be an extremely efficient mechanism to rapidly form a detonation wave, in spite of the low sensitivity of the fuel-air mixture at low pressures, weak shock used and absence of turbulence. The DDT mechanism, relies primarily on the straining of the flame shape into an elongated alligator flame maintained by the anchoring mechanism in a bifurcated lambda shock due to boundary layers.
