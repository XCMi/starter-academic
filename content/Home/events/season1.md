Abstract:
The present talk examined the role of instability on the predictability of detonation dynamics by investigating detonations in mixtures with varying levels of cellular instability, from the less unstable hydrogen-oxygen-argon system to the highly unstable methane-oxygen. Steady detonation waves, propagated in channels with exponentially enlarging cross-sections, were obtained at the macro-scale. For all the mixtures tested, the characteristic D−K relationships, relating the detonation mean propagation speed with lateral flow divergence, were obtained directly from experiments and as well from the generalized ZND model with lateral strain rates using detailed chemical kinetics. The comparisons first demonstrated the excellent agreement between experiments and the ZND model predictions for the weakly unstable hydrogen-oxygen-argon detonations, while significant departures for the highly unstable hydrocarbon-oxygen detonations. The results further showed that the degree of departure between experiments and the theoretical predictions increases significantly with the detonation instability level. Such a strong link between the departure level and the detonation instability can be clarified by the role of significant unreacted gas pockets in the ignition and propagation mechanism of unstable detonations. Finally, a novel quasi-2D approach modelling the lateral boundary layer losses using Mirels’ theory was proposed for evaluating the effect of boundary layer losses on 2D detonation cellular structures.
